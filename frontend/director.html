        <!-- HISTORY -->
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            Miyazaki was born in Tokyo as the second son of four brothers. His father, Katsuji Miyazaki,
            owned the Miyazaki Airplane Mfg. Co., Ltd (宮崎航空機製作所) located in Tochigi Prefecture. 
            During the Second World War, the family was evacuated to Utsunomiya, where Miyazaki lived 
            until his third grade of elementary school.
            <br><br>
            He later moved to Eifuku, Suginami, Tokyo. As a child, he was weak and not good at sports,
            but excelled at drawing. He was influenced by mangakas like Osamu Tezuka and Shigeru Sugiura,
            and picture books by Tetsuji Fukushima. During high school, he developed an interest in animation,
            especially after watching Toei Animation’s film Panda and the Magic Serpent (1958).
            <br><br>
            Influenced by Impressionist painter Paul Cézanne, Miyazaki shaped a storytelling style that
            was logical yet child-friendly. He joined the Children's Literature Circle at Gakushuin University,
            creating puppet shows and manga. After graduation, he worked as an animator at Toei Animation,
            struggling with the rigid work atmosphere but continuing his dream of becoming a cartoonist.
