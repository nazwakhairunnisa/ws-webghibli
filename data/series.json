The detective elements are light and instead replaced with the Watson's strange inventions. The added police and chase sequences keep the tone light and fun.

      "plot": "Film Guru Guru is based on a concept by ​​ Hayao Miyazaki to show audiences how old film projectors worked.  A special projector called Film Guru Guru (literally translated as Film Round and Round ) was installed in the Room of the Beginning of Movement , a permanent exhibition room located in the basement of the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, Tokyo. An 80-meter film is spun at a speed of 24 frames per second on 124 reels, and short animations are projected on three screens. Additionally, there are three points where the picture appears to move in a single frame by projecting a blinking strobe light directly on the film from behind. This special light blinks at a slightly slower speed than the film's running speed (the light blinks 23.3 times versus 24 frames per second) providing an added dimension to the motion. There are a total of eight short animated works produced for Film Guru Guru . A Splendid Ball , Rambutan Adventures , and Fish Fish , were initially available in a single reel of film when the museum opened on October 1, 2001. Tacolator , Piyopiyo Baba , and Bobo-kun , were added On November 27, 2002. In March 2005, sound effects were added to the exhibit. The film were replaced with Madalan World on April 18, 2007. That film was then replaced with Evolution on November 17, 2008. Madalan World and Evolution do not have sound effects, while the other six films with sound effects were moved into a mini-theater exhibit in the same permanent exhibition area. Film Guru Guru consists of the eight original motion pictures, featuring work by veteran animation director Atsuko Tanaka .",
