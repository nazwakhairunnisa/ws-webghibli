    ghibli:synopsis "Late one night, the civilian airship Saturn travels swiftly through the clouds. Amongst the passengers aboard are Sheeta , the owner of a strange blue stone necklace , and Colonel Muska , the government's secret agent who has abducted her and seized her necklace. Without warning, a squadron of air pirates, led by Dola , attack the airship in search of Sheeta and her necklace. During the ensuing chaos caused by the intrusion, Sheeta manages to knock Muska unconscious and retrieve her necklace. The pirates then break into her room; she attempts to hide by climbing outside and clinging to the exterior of the aircraft. However, she loses her grip and plummets into the dark sky below. As the unconscious Sheeta hurtles toward the ground, the stone on her necklace emits a mysterious light, slowing her descent significantly. From the small mining town of Slag Ravine , which just so happens to be directly underneath her, a young orphan miner named Pazu sees a distant light falling from the sky. He runs toward the light to investigate, only to find that its source is indeed the stone that Sheeta is still wearing, whom Pazu reaches out to catch. To his amazement, she feels weightless until her stone deactivates. Pazu tries to tell his boss, Mr. Duffi , of her sudden appearance, but is unable to amidst the bustle of the mining work. The miners have had no luck lately finding any coal or tin and have to start over as all the mines to the east have nothing either.  Once the mine is shut down for the night, he carries Sheeta back to his house. The next morning, Sheeta awakens to the sound of Pazu playing his trumpet on the roof. After introducing each other, Pazu asks to see her stone. Believing that her necklace is the reason for her surviving the fall, he tries to levitate himself with it, only to crash through the roof of the old blast furnace that his house is built with. After making sure he is unhurt from the mishap, Sheeta notices a photograph of Laputa, otherwise believed " ;

    ghibli:synopsis "A woman with thick, curly red hair is tailed by a yellow car with mechanical pinchers on the highway. She flees by motorcycle with a baby swaddled to her chest with a blanket. The baby peacefully chews on a tape titled \"Earwig\" in pen. The woman has magical capabilities, using a lock of her hair and turning it into worms to obscure the car's vision as she successfully gets away to St Morwald's Home for Children. The woman tells Earwig, the toddler, that she has to stay at St Morwald's now before leaving her on the doorstep. Earwig's cries bring two women to retrieve her from outside, also picking up the blanket with a note attached to it. The note says \"Got 12 other witches all chasing me. I'll be back for her when I've shook them off. It may take years. Her name is Earwig.\" The younger woman, Thelma, reading the note aloud ponders what the child's mother had done to anger the other witches in her coven. The elderly woman, holding Earwig, finds the idea of witches to be \"rubbish\" and dislikes the name Earwig. She is also Matron of the Home. She renames Earwig to Erica Wigg. Years later the children of the home rush outside dressed as sheet ghosts. Erica sneaks off with a friend with a key to the bell tower. Her friend, a boy named Custard , is reluctant to join her sneaking into the building, but joins her as he is too afraid to wait outside. She taunts him with scary stories on the way to the roof, where they look at everything for miles. They spot a ship in the water, marveling at it and wishing they could be on it. Custard then asks if Erica has ever wanted a family or to be somewhere other than the Home. Erica shrugs it off and says not at all. She then adds that no one would want to choose her unless they were unusual. She finds a normal family to be worse, where at the Home, everyone does what she wants. She even goes on to recite the words told to her as a baby when initially dropped off at the home, that there is plenty of sunshine from the large windows and" ;

    ghibli:synopsis "The story is set in Japan in 1963 taking place in the seaport town of Yokohama. In preparation for the 1964 Summer Olympics to be held in Tokyo , people are destroying remnants of the past because they believe only in the magnificence of the new. A 16-year-old girl, Umi Matsuzaki , lives in her grandmother's boarding house called \"Coquelicot Manor\", which is located on the hill overlooking the harbour of the Port of Yohohama .  Umi's father has passed away and her mother is in America studying so she helps clean and cook for the boarders and look after her sister and brother.  In the town of Yohohama rather than telling the season based on the flowers that are blooming, they can tell what time of year it is by what boats are passing through the harbor.  Each morning, she raises a set of signal flags with the message of \"I pray for safe voyages\". A 17-year-old boy, Shun Kazama , always sees this flag from the sea as he rides a tugboat to school and responds to them, but Umi doesn't know that.  Several of the boarders include Miss Sahurah, Miki a doctor and Sashiko an artist.  After breakfast, Umi does some final cleaning before heading off to school. At Konan Academy , Umi and Shun's high school, Umi's friends show her a poem that was written in the school newspaper about her raising flags which means someone is getting Umi's messages.  Meanwhile a dispute is being raised about the fate of old school's club house called The Latin Quarter . While the school administration as well as most students wants to demolish the old and dilapidated building, a group of students including Shun struggle to preserve it.  In an act of protest during lunch Shun jumps off the roof and into the water, when Umi rushes to help him, she realizes this was just for attention as pictures are taken and lets him fall into the water again.  After arriving home, Umi goes to see her grandmother who tells her how much she appreciates her hardwork even though they have a maid.  She also tells Umi s" ;

    ghibli:synopsis "The movie begins in modern-day Sannomiya Station, Kōbe, Hyōgo Prefecture, but then quickly flashes back to the past. Seita lies on the platform in rags and is dying from starvation. An onlooker remarks at how dirty he looked while another says, \"The American troops will be arriving soon. It would be an embarrassment if they find such a guy here at the station.\" Later that night, a janitor comes and digs through his things; finding a candy tin that contains Setsuko's ashes. He throws it out, and from there springs the spirits of Setsuko , Seita and a group of fireflies. The implication is that their spirits now haunt the station and that they will now provide the narrative throughout the story. As Seita begins to recount his past trauma, things flash back to the end of World War II, during the Kōbe fire bombings by American B-29 bombers. Setsuko and Seita, the two siblings and protagonists, are left to secure their house and their belongings in order to allow their mother , who suffers from a heart condition, to precede them to the bomb shelter. The young boy carries Setsuko on his back, and runs through the streets where people jostle each other in panic; he finally flees towards the sea. Once in safety, and after having let pass the black rain of the bombs that pours on his town, he undertakes to return towards the charred ruins with his little sister. A man announces through a megaphone the gathering at school for the inhabitants of his neighborhood. Learning that his mother has been injured, he leaves Setsuko with a family friend and goes in search of his mother. Their mother had been fatally injured in the air raid and is taken to a makeshift hospital which is actually a school, where she dies from burn wounds. Setsuko cries bitterly, while Seita tries to entertain her, hiding his own distress. She is cremated with several other corpses, and Seita collects a few meager bones in a small box.

She rushes home and informs her mother, Kokiri (who is working on a potion), that she plans to leave home that very evening instead of the following month as she had originally planned. As Kiki rushes to her room to pack, Kokiri informs her client Dora of the age-old tradition that 13-year-old witches had to leave home for a year on the night of a full moon to pursue their skill through training.

    ghibli:synopsis "Taking place in 1950s Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his two daughters, Satsuki and Mei are moving into an old house in the country to be closer to the hospital where their mother Yasuko is recovering from a long-term illness. While helping set up the house Satsuki and Mei find that the place is inhabited by tiny animated dust creatures called Soot Sprites - small, dark, dust-like house spirits seen when moving from light to dark places.  While the girls can see them, their father can't, however an elderly woman that takes care of the house (whom the girls can call Granny) tells them she used to see Soot sprits when she was their age.  She explains that they live in old empty house and cover the place with dirt, when a family moves into the house they move out and find a new home.  Soon they all get to work cleaning the house and unpacking.  Later on, Granny's grandson and their new neighbor Kanta comes by with a basket but acts shy around Satsuki.  When the girls become comfortable in their new house and laugh with their father, the soot spirits leave the house to drift away on the wind.  They are shown floating towards the Kamfore tree which is their true home. Soon they go to the hospital to visit their mom who is improving, the doctors say that she should be able to come home in 2 weeks.

    ghibli:synopsis "This film is about the daily lives of the Yamada family: Takashi and Matsuko (the father and mother), Shige (Matsuko's mother), Noboru (aged approximately 13, the son), Nonoko (aged approximately 7, the daughter), and Pochi (the family dog). It has a significantly different \"feel\" to it than other Studio Ghibli films, not only because of its different style of animation, but also because it is not a contiguous plot, but rather a series of vignettes, each preceded by a title such as \"Father as Role Model\", \"A Family Torn Apart\" or \"Patriarchal Supremacy Restored\". These vignettes cover such issues as losing a child in a department store, the relationships between father and son, or husband and wife, the wisdom of age, getting one's first girlfriend and many more. Each is presented with humour, presenting a very believable picture of family life which crosses cultural boundaries. The relationships between Matsuko, Takashi and Shige are particularly well observed, with Shige giving advice and proverbs to all the family members and having a great strength of character which far outweighs Matsuko's. Takashi and Matsuko's the focus of the episodes, their rivalries, such as arguing about who has control of the television, their frustrations and their difficulties, but the overriding theme is their love for one another, despite their flaws, and their desire to be the best parents possible for their children." ;

Scattered human settlements survive, isolated from one another by the Sea of Decay. The Sea of Decay is a jungle of giant plants and fungi swarming with giant insects, which seem to come together only to wage war. Everything in the Sea of Decay, including the air, is lethally toxic.  Lord Yupa sword master and explorer has spent a year traveling to see if there are any cities left and sadly every village he has visited has been consumed by the toxic jungles or destroyed through war and fire. Meanwhile Nausicaä is the agile and cheerful young 16-year-old princess of the peaceful Valley of the Wind. Although a skillful fighter, Miyazaki's Nausicaä is humane and peace-loving. She has an unusual gift for communicating with the giant insects (particularly with the Ohmu , the gigantic, armored, caterpillar-like insects who are the most intelligent creatures in the Sea of Decay). She is also noted for her empathy toward animals, humans, and other beings. An intelligent girl, and inspired by the mentor figure Yupa, a wandering samurai type possessed of great wisdom, Nausicaä frequently explores the Sea of Decay and conducts scientific experiments in an attempt to define the true nature and origins of the toxic world in which she lives. Her explorations are facilitated by her skill at \"windriding\"; flying with an advanced glider-like craft with a jet assist called a möwe. Yupa is searching for the mythological man in blue who, according to the legend, will appear surrounded by a sea of gold and reunite the people and nature. One evening, an airship (a kind of large cargo airplane) from the kingdom of Tolmekia travels through the Valley, noticing it's off course Nausicaä tries to guide the ship, unfortunately the ship is attacked by insects.

In Kōchi, two years prior, Taku receives a call from his friend, Yutaka Matsuno, asking to meet at their high school. He finds Yutaka at a window, watching an attractive female transfer student whom Yutaka was asked to show around. The boys discuss their upcoming school trip to Hawaii. At the school gates, Taku is introduced to the new girl, Rikako Muto. She thanks Yutaka for providing directions to a bookstore. Taku teases Yutaka about his infatuation. Rikako is academically gifted and good at sports, but also arrogant. Taku believes she is unhappy about leaving Tokyo. His mother learns from gossip that a divorce brought Rikako's mother to Kōchi. In a phone conversation with Yutaka, he discovers that Rikako is living away from the family house. The school year ends, heralding the Hawaii trip. Taku, suffering from an upset stomach, is stopped in the hotel lobby by Rikako. She explains that she has lost her money and asks to borrow some. As Taku has a part-time job, he lends her ¥60,000. Promising to repay him, she warns not to tell anyone. As she departs, Taku sees a stern Yutaka and feels compelled to explain. Later, Rikako admonishes him for telling Yutaka about the money, saying that he also loaned her ¥20,000. Back in Kōchi, the third year begins with Rikako making a friend, Yumi Kohama. Rikako hasn't returned Taku's money and he wonders if she has forgotten. Out of the blue, a distressed Yumi calls Taku, explaining that Rikako had tricked her into coming to the airport on the pretence of a concert trip, only to discover that their real destination is Tokyo, tickets paid for with Taku's money.

She decides to take another trip to visit the family of the elder brother of her brother-in-law in the rural countryside to help with the safflower harvest and get away from city life. While traveling at night on a sleeper train to Yamagata, she begins to recall memories of herself as a schoolgirl in 1966, and her intense desire to go on holiday like her classmates, all of whom have family outside of the big city. At the arrival train station, she is surprised to find out that her brother in law's second cousin Toshio, whom she barely knows, is the one who came to pick her up. During her stay in Yamagata, she finds herself increasingly nostalgic and wistful for her childhood self, while simultaneously wrestling with adult issues of career and love. The trip dredges up forgotten memories (not all of them good ones) — the first stirrings of childish romance, puberty and growing up, the frustrations of math and boys. In lyrical switches between the present and the past, Taeko wonders if she has been true to the dreams of her childhood self. In doing so, she begins to realize that Toshio has helped her along the way. Finally, Taeko faces her own true self, how she views the world and the people around her. Taeko chooses to stay in the countryside instead of returning to Tokyo. It is implied that she and Toshio begin a relationship." ;

After making a few stops at some local stores, Mimiko comes home to her house in a bamboo grove and finds a baby panda named Panny sleeping on the back doorstep. She quickly makes friends with the little panda, and invites him in for a drink. His father, Papa Panda , soon comes to visit, and they decide to become a family after Papa Panda offers to be Mimiko's father (Mimiko never had any parents). The three adjust to life together during their first night together, while Mimiko writes the first of many letters to her grandma (who she promised to write to every day). The next day, Mimiko goes to school, reluctantly allowing Panny to tag along (even though she told him to stay home). In a close call, Panny ends up getting all of Mimiko's school (save for Mimiko) chasing after him. The next day, Mimiko gets an unexpected visit from a local policeman, who came to check on her. Expectedly, he freaks out after seeing Papa Panda. He goes to notify the local zoo staff, who invites the zookeeper (who lost Papa Panda and Panny after they broke out of the zoo). The zookeeper demands the safe return of his pandas, so he joins the police and zoo staff in the search. Meanwhile, Mimiko and her family go out on a walk and, after scaring off some local bullies, they inadvertently lose Panny after he rolls down a hill.

As it turns out, Curtis asked her to marry him but she refused as all three of her previous husbands were pilots as well but all three of them were killed (she even got word about her recent husband's death).  Gina admits that she had spent so long crying that she has now run out of tears.  There's a photo of several pilots and Gina on the wall, dated 1912 which Porco hates. Gina says she loves that picture but still can't believe he  scribbled out his own head.  Gina wishes that there was some way to break his curse but he says that's he a pig and that's that.

    ghibli:synopsis "Princess Mononoke follows the journey of the last Emishi prince, Ashitaka , and his attempts to make peace between the human settlement, Irontown , and the creatures living in the forest that surrounds it. The film begins with Ashitaka riding on his red elk to warn three girls to return to the village as per the wise woman's orders.  Ashitaka then heads to the lookout tower where Ji tells Ashitaka something is in the forest, seconds later a demon who is actually the giant boar god Nago embodied by rage comes out of the forest.  He ends up saving his village from a vicious assault by killing the demon. During the fight, Ashitaka receives a demon mark on his right arm, and he is cursed by the Boar God's hatred and pain. Ashitaka is told that the mark will spread throughout his body, killing him. A ball of iron is found inside Nago's corpse, which is somehow connected to the curse.  The Wise Woman says that Ashitaka will have to leave the village forever, this upsets three of the men present especially since Ashitaka risked his life to save them but one man quietly points out that they are the last of the Emishi people and now their last prince must be exiled from their land, never to come back. Ashitaka resolves to journey to Nago's origin, the lands to the West, to try and find a cure for his curse. He cuts his hair, signifying his permanent departure from his village, and rides out with Yakul , his loyal red elk. Since it was considered taboo to see off one who is banished, only one person dared to say goodbye to Ashitaka: his 'little sister,' Kaya (according to Miyazaki, actually his bride-to-be; calling herself his 'little sister' was a term of affection), who gives him her crystal dagger so that he would not forget her. Having traveled some distance, Ashitaka soon ends up in the middle of a Samurai attack.  He is spotted and tries to escape but is chased.  Left with not much of a choice, Ashitaka fires his bow and arrow, this causes his cursed arm to react and ca" ;

    ghibli:synopsis "Chihiro Ogino , a disaffected child, is annoyed about having to move to a new town. She is traveling with her parents in their 1996 Audi A4 Quattro to their new home. While driving to their new house, Chihiro's father attempts to follow a shortcut; they subsequently lose their way and come across a mysterious red gate and a tunnel which exits to a clock tower and leads to what appears to be an abandoned theme park , lined with seemingly empty restaurants. Finding a restaurant fully-stocked with unattended food, both parents eat the food they find there and, as a result, transform into pigs. Chihiro's distress at losing her parents is compounded by the discoveries that the world around her has changed and that her body seems to be disappearing. A mysterious boy named Haku appears, comforts Chihiro, and gives her a red berry to eat, which makes her solid again. He smuggles her into a large bathhouse owned and operated by the evil witch Yubaba , where thousands of spirits come to refresh themselves. Haku tells Chihiro that the only way she can remain in the spirit-world long enough to rescue her parents is by gaining employment in Yubaba's bathhouse. When Chihiro asks Haku how he seems to know her so well, Haku replies that he has known Chihiro since she was very small. At first, she tries to get work with Kamajī , who works at the boiler room , but is rejected. Kamajī instead hands Chihiro off to the worker, Lin , to take her to Yubaba. In Yubaba's penthouse suite , Chihiro repeatedly asks for a job, overriding the monstrous witch's refusals. Yubaba ultimately consents, on condition that Chihiro give up her name. Yubaba literally takes possession of Chihiro's real name (荻野 千尋 , Ogino Chihiro) by grasping the kanji characters from Chihiro's signed contract, leaving Chihiro with one part of one character of her original two-character name, in isolation pronounced \"Sen\" (千).

The ship's weatherworker is distressed to realize that he has lost the power to control the wind and waves, but is even more disturbed when he observes two dragons fighting above the clouds where one of them is eventually killed. Shortly thereafter the King of Enlad , already troubled by tales of drought and pestilence in the land, receives news both of the strange omen at sea and of the disappearance of Prince Arren (the King's son). The King's wizard tells the tale of how dragons and men were once one, until dragons chose freedom and men chose possessions, and of his fears of how the land's plight is due to a weakening of the Balance. The King has little time to ponder on this before he is set upon and fatally stabbed in a dark corridor by a young lad, who turns out to be Arren where the prince steals his father's sword and flees the palace while his father dies from the wound inflicted by Arren. The action now moves to a desert where Arren is pursued by wolves and he is rescued (despite refusing to defend himself) by a wizard who turns out to be Sparrowhawk the Archmage. During a conversation between the two, Sparrowhawk notes the magical nature of Arren's father's sword and expresses his doubt that Arren can unsheathe such a weapon. Arren, not having any direction in Life, accompanies Sparrowhawk to the town of Hort . When he's left to explore the town alone, he suddenly becomes scared as if something is following him. As Arren runs away, he sees a girl fleeing from slave hunters.  He intervenes and saves her, though his \"bravery\" is but a reflection of his death-wish and not truly a heroic act.  The girl recognizes this at once and runs away from him and towards a woman's voice calling her name Therru . That evening, Arren is captured by the same slave hunter but loses his father's sword as the hunter believes it to be worthless junk.

He decides that it is time to take another chance, and, with Jigen, heads off to the purported source of the bills, the Principality of Cagliostro. Shortly after arriving, they rescue a young girl from a car full of thugs, only to let her get captured again when Lupin is knocked unconscious after tumbling down a cliff. They later discover that she is Clarisse , the princess of Cagliostro and is engaged to be married to the Count Cagliostro, the country's ruler.

Their escapades are interrupted by Amanda's mother, Lizzie, who is exasperated by her daughter's aloof behavior and fixation on a friend who, as far as she can tell, does not exist. While on a day trip with Lizzie, Amanda and Rudger encounter the menacing Mr. Bunting and his own Imaginary, a sullen girl in black. Revealing himself to be a hunter and devourer of exceptional Imaginaries, he decides Rudger is his next mark. As the two children flee from the man in a panic, Amanda is hit by a car, the accident appearing to be fatal. Now alone, Rudger begins to disappear, since Imaginaries cease to exist once their creator forgets them. Zinzan, a mysterious cat, persuades the boy to follow him to a sanctuary for Imaginaries at risk of vanishing. The sanctuary is a real-life library, where Imaginaries are sustained by the creative energies of the books within. Among the dozens like himself, Rudger befriends the skeletal Cruncher-of-Bones, Snowflake the Hippo, and Emily, who is a leader among the library's inhabitants. Over dinner that night, Rudger asks Emily about Mr. Bunting, and she explains that he was once a mortal human man who was so desperate to preserve his Imaginary, he resorted to consuming other Imaginaries, which has sustained the both of them for hundreds of years. At the conclusion of her story, she insists Bunting is nothing but a myth, much to Rudger's frustration. The following morning, Emily tasks Rudger with his new job, where he'll spend the day with a child in need of pretend playmates. He selects John, one of Amanda's classmates, as his first assignment. At the end of the day, he spots Bunting lurking outside of John's home, and confronts him about Amanda coming to harm.

    ghibli:synopsis "A nameless man set adrift by a storm wakes up on a deserted island. The man finds that the island is rich in resources, finding fresh fruit and water as well as a variety of small animals and a dense bamboo forest. After he falls into an isolated cave, the man swims downward and narrowly swims out of the cave. That night, he watches as many sea turtles paddle out to sea. Later on, he prepares to leave the island. The man builds a raft from bamboo, and attempts to sail away. However, an unseen sea creature destroys the raft, forcing the man back to the island. Attempting to escape with another raft, his plan is foiled again by the sea creature. Trying a third time, his raft is again destroyed, but once in the water, he finds a red turtle facing him. The turtle does not harm the man, and the man retreats back to the island. That evening, the man sees the red turtle crawling on the shore, attempting to go inland. In revenge, he hits the red turtle on the head with a bamboo stick, and pushes it over on its back. After halfway through building another raft, the man starts to feel remorse about leaving the turtle upside-down and tries to save the turtle by flipping it over, but it's too heavy. He desperately runs to get some water to revive the turtle, but realizes that it's dead, and falls asleep next to it.

The girl grows rapidly and conspicuously, marveling her parents and earning her the nickname \"Takenoko\" (Little Bamboo) from the other children in the village.

    ghibli:synopsis "The story of Jirō Horikoshi unfolds as a captivating tale of a young boy living in a quaint provincial town in Japan. He dreams of a day when he could design and possibly fly airplanes, as aviation becomes the passion that drives him. However, his dreams are dealt a devastating blow as his eyesight begins to rapidly deteriorate, preventing him from ever piloting an aircraft. Jirō's heart is filled with hopeless longing, and even in his dreams, he faces the haunting vision of falling from the very airplanes he yearns to control. His eyes struggle to withstand the pressure of high altitudes, reinforcing the seemingly insurmountable barriers standing between him and his aspirations. In a desperate quest to overcome his physical weakness and pursue his dreams, Jirō seeks help and guidance from Giovanni Caproni, a famous Italian aircraft designer who appears to him in his reveries. Caproni becomes a mentor and source of inspiration, encouraging Jirō to embrace a different path—that of an aeronautical engineer. With Caproni's wise counsel, Jirō discovers a new purpose for his boundless creativity and love for aircraft. By becoming an aeronautical engineer, he can channel his passion into designing airplanes, transcending the limitations of his eyesight while still contributing significantly to the world of aviation. Determined to become an aeronautical engineer one day, Jirô studies the principles of aviation throughout his academic years, continuously seeking guidance and encouragement from Caproni along the way. By the time he is an adult, he is able to enter the University of Tokyo to study aeronautics. Boarding a train, he makes his way to the Kanto region of Japan.

This existence is interrupted, however, by the arrival of a tank-like scorpion fly, which he narrowly avoids before it kills two of the other caterpillars and carries them off. The rest of the caterpillars hastily leave the plant, leaving it mostly dead. As Boro considers his next moves, he is unexpectedly flung into the air onto the dress of a girl biking through the field where his plant is. The girl returns home, where her mother notices Boro and gently places him on a leaf before escorting him outside. Boro, caught in unfamiliar surroundings, is initially fearful once again, but notices more photosynthesis and lowers himself onto the head of its source: a beautiful dandelion, which he gleefully claims as his new home." ;

    ghibli:plot "During an average day in Tokyo, the narrator is shocked by the arrival of her brother, who has been away at college. He tells her that a great disaster is coming and the city will be destroyed tomorrow. She exclaims that it is just a rumor being spread around the Internet, but her sibling insists. He explains that before every disaster there is an omen or warning that precedes it. The narrator becomes frightened and believes the person in front of her to be an imposter. He tells her that he is the omen and that she should carefully decide how to react to this event before vanishing before her. Meanwhile, glowing spores have descended upon Tokyo, eventually coalescing to form an enormous being that hovers above the city. The narrator explains that gods are not only creators, but also destroyers, which is why humans worship them. The giant being begins aimlessly walking through Tokyo as the city's inhabitants look on. Suddenly, it stops and its mouth opens to reveal a device that unleashes a horrifying beam that ravages Tokyo, destroying the entire city and leaving a mushroom cloud in its wake. The narrator explains that the world has a set life span and that, if it were up to humans, life would be prolonged indefinitely. Despite its inhabitants' objections, the Earth itself called upon the God Warrior to initiate the Seven Days of Fire which will end the planet's existence. She believes that if the Earth took seven days to create, it will take just as long to destroy it. As the entire legion of God Warriors descend upon the ruins of Tokyo, the narrator says that she will forego what the gods have planned and is awaiting what will remain after they have destroyed Earth.

One blustery Autumn day, on the way to the market to sell some vegetables he has grown, a boy named Nona meets two strange men, Scopello and Makinso , traveling together. They are next to a train that seems to have suddenly stopped in the middle of nowhere (there are no tracks). The men open some cases they are carrying and announce that they are selling planets.

    ghibli:plot "The film is unique in that Hayao Miyazaki appears as an anthropomorphic pig character, introducing the flying machines that first appeared in Laputa: Castle in the Sky and various \"flying machines\" that were inspired by artists in 19th century science fiction. According to Miyazaki's avatar, flying freely in the sky has long been a longing for humankind, and before the advancement of science and technology, it relied on magic or human power. However, with the invention of various machines due to the development of science, people came to believe that they could fly anything by reducing the weight of engines and gears and increasing the number of propellers, and many unusual things in 19th century European scientific novels. Throughout the film, various flying machines make an appearance. Airships that fly through the air on oars, balloons that open and close parasols, airplanes in the shape of bats and fish, wooden flying boxes that take electricity from the air, propeller armored ships of aerial pirates, aerial taxis that fly freely in the city, etc. All manner of bizarre vehicles fill the sky, reminiscent to the opening to Laputa: Castle in the Sky . Many of these designs are reminiscent of works by Jules Verne and Albert Robida are seen. Eventually, these fantastical flying machines evolve steadily into the technology we see in the real world, and now anyone can travel by air. Time passes and passenger airships give way to futuristic space craft that can be all across the sky. Miyazaki's avatar steps into one such airships, and we see images of what it must be like being in one of them. The film then poses the question, has humanity's desire to fly in the sky been fulfilled? No, now and in the future, humanity's longing for the sky will never disappear. At the end of the story, a boy who who resembles Pazu from Laputa: Castle in the Sky takes off into the sky on the red and white ornithopter called \" Alcione \"." ;

The mountain where the trees were \"komon\" is full of water, and akebi and mushrooms can be picked up for Ito. The land is rich and bountiful. However, if Ito doesn't cut down the tree and burns charcoal, he won't be able to make living. The spirits that objected to cutting the tree said, \"Then there is no way to cut down the tree. But burn me a nice charcoal.\" This is a mysterious story about Kenji Miyazawa telling people that they do are not the only thing who live in this world." ;

She approaches him cautiously, but Monmon's advances are rebuffed. Since then, Monmon, dejected, can only watch the water strider from afar. Suddenly, the water strider is attacked and nearly eaten by a fish. Monmon saves her by taking her underwater and protects her in a bubble of oxygen that he made. When the water strider awakens, she is startled at Monmon staring at her closely, and quickly leaves. As the clouds darken and rain begins to pour, Monmon swims sadly to the bottom of the lake, waiting for dawn to come. The next day, the water strider zips across the lake and spots Monmon as he surfaces from underwater. She stares at him intently, and slowly extends her appendage towards him. Monmon, reluctant at first, taps at her appendage until they held each other closely. The water strider happily then takes Monmon across the lake, but he struggles to keep up until finally are in sync in their movements. A fish suddenly appears and tries to eat them both, but thankfully, the water strider stretches her wings and flies the both of them to safety. Monmon is content, until the water strider finally lets go and he swims away. The water strider waves goodbye, perhaps signaling they will see each other soon. We then see that life goes on in the lake." ;

Co., Ltd (宮崎航空機製作所, Miyazaki Kōkūki Seisakusho ), and their factory was based in Tochigi Prefecture in Kanuma. When the Second World War began, their family was evacuated to Utsunomiya. It was here that Miyazaki stayed until his third grade of elementary school. He moved to Eifuku, Suginami, Tokyo where he studied until 4th grade of elementary school in 1950. When he was a child, he described himself as weak and was not good at exercising. Despite his physical deficiencies, he excelled at drawing. He was an avid reader and a big fan of mangakas like Osamu Tezuka and Shigeru Sugiura. He also loved the pictures books of Tetsuji Fukushima, particularly The Devil of the Savage . When he was in third year at Toyotama High School, he grew interested in animation and was greatly influenced by Toei Animation and their film Panda and the Magic Serpent (1958). He taught himself drawing at Fumio Sato's atelier and was influenced by Impressionist painters like Paul Cézanne. His direction as a filmmaker to produce child-friendly but logically-plotted content was also affected with his experiences as a child to watch child-friendly films. He cited Gamera vs. Viras as a bad example for the entire humanity to surrender to aliens for the sake of two children, while the Gamera has later associated with Studio Ghibli in productions and distributions . [ 2 ] He entered Gakushuin University and joined the Children's Literature Circle (Children's Culture Study Group). While helping plan several puppet shows, he continued drawing manga with the goal of becoming a professional manga artist, but decided to move into the world of animation. After graduating from Gakushuin University, he joined Toei Animation as an animator. He struggled with the workmanlike atmosphere of Toei Animation, and never stopped his dream of being a cartoonist.

    ghibli:history "Gorō Miyazaki was born in 1967 and is the eldest son to animators Hayao Miyazaki and Akemi Ōta in Tokyo, Japan. His family then settled in Tokorozawa City, Saitama Prefecture in 1970. While growing up, Gorō and his younger brother Keisuke found sketches of their parents' work. He would also become a fan of artistic duo Fujiko Fujio's manga Doraemon . Since his father was rarely at home, Gorō  resorted to studying his parent's animation projects in order to understand and communicate with him. He would often speak with Mamoru Oshii , who is a close family friend. As a high school student, Gorō thought that he \"would never be able to reach the level [his father] has attained.\" Gorō instead decided to pursue landscape architecture [ 1 ] as he became interested in the nature conservation. His decision to study at Shinshu University was due to its proximity to the mountains, which reminded him of his time in high school. After graduating from Shinshu University's School of Agriculture, Gorō later worked at Mori Building Co., Japan's leading urban landscape developer, as a construction consultant in the planning and designing of children parks such as  Okaya Kohan Park and general parks and landscape design of industrial parks. Gorō was later invited by Toshio Suzuki to help design Ghibli Museum in Mitaka. [ 2 ] Inspired by his father's plan he answered, \"I'll do it\", and promptly retired from Mori. [ 3 ] In 1998, he became the representative director of Museo Darte Ghibli Co., the operating company behind the Ghibli Museum. He served as its director from 2001 to June 2005. [ 4 ] In October 2001, he became the first president of Mamma Auito Co., and received the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Newcomer Award in the Art Promotion Division at the 2004 Art Awards.

    ghibli:history "Takahata was originally intrigued by animation after having seen the French animated cartoon feature Le Roi et l'oiseau ( The King and the Mockingbird ) based on the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. He was impressed by the film, asking \"Can these kind of things be done by animation?\". While he was job hunting at his university, Takahata was tempted to join Toei Animation by a friend who knew the company wanted an assistant director at the time. For fun he took the company's entrance examination as he had been originally interested in animation. When he was notified of the informal decision, he joined the company. The reason he decided to join the company was his thought that \"If it was animation, I can be something interesting, too.\" However, there were more than ten people joining the company that same year, two recruited by Toei Animation side recruited and the surplus workers sent by Toei head office. Because of the competition, he had a hard time achieving the status of director. Takahata finally directed his first film after he was recommended for the spot by Yasuo Ōtsuka , who was both his and Hayao Miyazaki's instructor. His directorial debut was Hols: Prince of the Sun . Hols was a failure in the commercial sense. He was among the production team deemed responsible for the failure, and was accordingly demoted. He also had difficulty making a new film as the remaining staff members who had not been demoted for Hols were working on a different Toei film. In 1971, in order to make the animated feature Pippi Longstocking , Takahata left Toei Animation with Yoichi Kotabe and Hayao Miyazaki and transferred to A production (present: SHIN-EI ANIMATION Co., Ltd. )”, an animation studio founded by his former superior, Daikichiro Kusube ( 楠部大吉郎 , くすべ だいきちろう ) They travelled to Sweden to acquire the animation rights and to hunt for locations, only to be turned away at the door by author Astrid Lindgren. Though their plan was frustrated, Miyazaki found inspiration " ;

He was a regular collaborator of Hayao Miyazaki and the late Isao Takahata at Studio Ghibli ." ;
    ghibli:history "Born on November 29, 1953, in Tokyo, Japan. During his subcontracting years at Studio Neo Media and A Pro, Momose worked on TV titles such as Tensai Bakabon (1971-1972), Dokonjo Gaeru (1972-1974), and Hajime Ningen Gyatorus (1974-1976) (scenes from which are featured in the NTV documentary A Ghibli Artisan - Kazuo Oga Exhibition . After Momose was recruited by Ghibli to do layout and other duties on Grave of the Fireflies , he continued with the studio as supervisor of key animation on Only Yesterday and Pom Poko . After doing key animation on Porco Rosso , Whisper of the Heart , and Spirited Away , and CG work on Princess Mononoke , Momose returned to working with Takahata on My Neighbors the Yamadas where he worked alongside Osamu Tanabe doing storyboards, setting scenes, and directing the animation (Momose handled these duties for the first half of that film, Tanabe did the honors for the second half). Animation scholar Ben Ettinger writes: \"I've long felt Yoshiyuki Momose to be the person doing the most interesting and creative work at Studio Ghibli for years now - both in his many lovely and original shorts of recent years and, prior to that, as one of the unsung heroes of Takahata's films. Without his technical mastery in the layouts and concept design, those films would not have half their impact. \"He is one of the few creators involved in the studio who seems to have it all: the ability to come up with interesting stories and engaging characters and bring them alive in a compelling and original visual concept. He has the technical knowhow of a 40 year career during which he has touched on just about every aspect of animation, from traditional animation to CG animation to directing to concept illustration. In my mind, he is the obvious and only candidate to helm a Ghibli feature post M&T. \"Momose has drawn just about everything that it's possible for someone to draw in the animation process, including key animation drawings, concept drawings, layouts, charact" ;
